Troches (In English)

Ingredients
2 tsp yeast
1 cup milk
3 Tbsp flour
3 Tbsp sugar
1 egg yolk
1 egg
2 Tbsp margarine
4 cups flour (this may be off slightly)

Steps

Proof yeast: Scald milk to a temperatore of 115-125 degrees Fahrenheit. Add yeast, 3 Tbsp flour and 3 Tbsp sugar. Let proof 5-8 minutes.

Combine margarine, egg yolk, and egg. Add flour and mix well. After yeast has proofed, add yeast mixture to the flour mixture. Let rise (time unspecified) in a warm place. Roll dough to a 2-3mm thickness (1/8 inch) on a floured surface. Cut out squares approximately 4 inches per side. 

Add filling to the center of each square. If using plain fruit, sprinkle sugar on top in order to avoid tartness.

Fold horns and place on greased baking tray in a preheated oven (180 degrees C) for about 20 minutes or until golden brown. Sprinkle with powdered sugar.

(P.S. I don't really understand that filling part in the recipe. I think it's 8oz cream cheese, 1 Tbsp sugar, 1 Tbsp flour, 2 eggs, raisins, and pudding. WIth the pudding, only add enough milk for one package of pudding, but use two packages of pudding. Don't know why you need pudding with the cream cheese though. Seems like whoever wrote the recipe was just kind of rambling at that point.)
