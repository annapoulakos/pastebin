Please visit these rule changes from time to time in order to make sure that you have an updated set of rules to follow.<br><br><font size="4"><font color="#8b0000"><b>Signups</b></font></font><br>If you are a cute newbee and would like to sign up for this, please forum PM me with the name of your pilot and how long you've been playing for. Be advised that we will likely begin the proceedings at 11am CST on Sunday morning. Or so. <br><br><font size="4"><font color="#8b0000"><b>Format</b></font></font><br><font color="#8B0000"><font size="2"><font color="#000000"><font size="3">The format for the current Hunger games is as follows:</font></font></font></font><br><ul class="bbc"><li>Newbees sign up for tournament.</li><li>30 minutes before the match starts, Newbees will be choosing their hulls. This will be done by placing a number of random hulls in a 10km circle around a specific player. Newbees will warp, in their pods, to the player and will then race to whichever hull they wish to fly. First newbee into a hull gets the hull. No exceptions.</li><li>15 minutes prior to the start of the match, the Booster draft will occur. Newbees will receive their boosters and choose one item/stack of ammo from their booster and pass it to the next person. Newbees will all be in the same fleet during this time, and will give their booster to the next person down from them alphabetically. The last person will give their booster to the first person.</li><li>At this point, there will be a 15 minute window where newbees may trade items amongst each other and also fit their ships. Once this window has expired, all newbees will receive a bookmark. They will all then leave fleet and fly to the bookmark. Once all newbees are accounted for, there will be a countdown and the match will begin.</li><li>This is a Free-For-All Thunderdome. The last newbee standing will be declared the winner.</li></ul><br><font size="4"><font color="#8b0000"><b>Sponsor Rules</b></font></font><br><br>If you'd like to be a newbee sponsor in the Hunger Games, you need to first let me know via forum PM. You will need to provide the pilot name as well as the newbee you wish to sponsor. You are able to choose whomever you wish to sponsor. There are a few rules that we will put in place in order to help make things fair.<br><br><ul class="bbc"><li>You have two options if you would like to be a sponsor: Sponsoring a Particular Newbee or Being Placed in the Sponsor Pool. If you sponsor a particular newbee, you will be removed from the pool of sponsors. If you are in the pool of sponsors, you will be given a newbee to sponsor from our list of available newbees. You can see the current list of Newbees and Sponsors on this page: <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AuvksaQ2vpqddE0wU0w4eG5nXzI5SmJKNUQ5UEMtd1E" class="bbc_url" title="External link" rel="nofollow external">https://docs.google....SmJKNUQ5UEMtd1E</a></li><li>Sponsors will be allowed to gift one item/stack of ammo/something per event. All sponsors of a particular newbee will have to get together to decide how they want to do the gift, but each newbee is allowed one and only one gift.</li><li>Gifts may be in the form of any module or ammo. This can mean faction or complex or officer, whatever you think the newbee can use. T2 modules are not allowed. Modules are limited to one module and ammo stacks can either be one item (for scripts), 3 items (for crystals), 10 items (for cap boosters) and 100 items (for all other ammo.)</li><li>All gifts must be approved by the Hunger Games committee. Please forum mail me, Doctor Benway, Kyle Myr, or Kallaystra with the details of your proposed gift. Once your gift has been approved, place it into a small container, name the container with your newbee, and contract it to Annasys (in Goonswarm) with the required fee and the comment "Sponsor Gift". These will be doled out after the booster draft.</li><li>All gifts require a monetary payment that will go into the Donation Pool with the name (Sponsor Gift). We will currently do all gifts on a per gift basis. Depending on what is being gifted in these first couple of events, we will make a list of common items and their required isk donation. Remember, all monies in the Donation Pool get split evenly amongst all contestants regardless of whether they win or lose the event.</li><li>At this time, there will not be any interference allowed during the event. Future events may allow things such as warping in a logistics for a single cycle of rep or cap or something. These will be discussed by the Hunger Games committee in order to assure that things stay relatively fair.</li></ul><br> <font size="5"><font color="#2e8b57"><b>Prizes</b></font></font><br>The following is the current prize list, including benefactors.<br><ul class="bbc"><li>Dancing Tree wins - Dread Guristas Warp Disruptor, from Annasys</li><li>Thellia Doshu wins - A T1 fit Noctis is going to the first to die. from an anonymous benefactor.</li><li>A T1 fit Noctis, plus stuff, from Eezee Gonozal (don't know how this is being given out yet.)</li><li>400,000,000.00 to the player with the most kills, from Hamlet Dynamic</li><li>Dancing Tree Wins - Faction Fit Dominix Navy Issue, from Ackbarre</li><li>Jryi Markus Ranta wins - Megathron, from Adolpha (Special instructions)</li><li>Mirotrem wins - Four Tacklemallers, from Richmond Kings (to the Amarr pilot with the most kills)</li><li>Jryi Markus Ranta wins - Fed Navy Comet, Taranis, Thorax, from sbealieu (to the Gallente pilot with the most kills)</li><li>Kitfox Mikakka (Disco Merlin) wins - The contents of Blawrf's Hangar in JU-, from Blawrf McTaggart.</li></ul><br><b><font size="5"><font color="#2e8b57">Donations</font></font></b><br>Player donations will be split evenly amongst the newbees attending each event.
